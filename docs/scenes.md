# Idlesse scenes, version 1

The desktop app can open an inspectable `.idlesse` directory from Wallpaper… or
as a document. `Examples/Aurora.idlesse` is a template; supply its video asset.

`manifest.json`:
```json
{"version":1,"title":"Aurora","capabilities":[]}
```

`scene.json`:
```json
{"layers":[{"type":"video","asset":"assets/aurora.mp4"}]}
```

Exactly one image or video layer is supported. Image assets use JPG/JPEG, PNG or
HEIC; video assets use MP4/MOV. Paths are relative to the package and must resolve
inside it. Each JSON document is limited to 64 KiB. Unknown versions and requested
capabilities fail explicitly. Preview art can be included but is not consumed yet.
No network access, scripts, signals or effects are implemented.

The desktop path is now LocalSceneSource → Playable → SceneRenderer →
WallpaperSurface. Resolution runs off the main thread, returns metadata only,
and checks cancellation before adoption. StaticImageRenderer retains the bounded
ImageIO path; VideoRenderer owns native muted looping playback. The host retains
the security-scoped package access and owns windows, pause, sleep and stop.

This is the first runtime seam, not a completed engine migration. Screensaver
ImageLibrary still uses its existing synchronous image path. Moving it to async
sources and extracting a Swift package are next; do not claim those are finished.
Cloud fetching, cache eviction, playlists, multiple layers and Studio are future
work. Scene assets must currently be locally readable, including synced files.

Run `./test.sh` for scene and image checks and `./test-wallpaper.sh` for real
renderer lifecycle checks, including a generated video scene package.
