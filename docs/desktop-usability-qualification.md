# Desktop usability qualification

Qualification checkpoint: app source `cb0ef06`, September 12, 2026.

| Requirement | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage-rest reveal delay | DesktopRevealPolicy tests cover slow dispatch, duplicate request, success grace, failure; live Show/Restore exercised | Implemented; visible animation latency not measured |
| Menu strip enabled for ordinary videos | Shared renderer predicate; plain-image/video on/off smoke checks; existing Hina produced paired presentation timestamps | Verified |
| Menu strip synchronization | Display 3: 1,330 pairs, 1.06 ms mean absolute skew, 12.50 ms max, 2 missed copies. Display 1: 1,166 pairs, 3.96 ms mean, 16.67 ms max, 246 misses | Measured sample; not atomic |
| Thumbnail memory and refresh | Bounded ImageIO thumbnail path, coalescing and stale-result rejection smoke checks | Verified |
| Library navigation and preview isolation | Home/Library smoke, real Ichika video poster, manual chooser/cancel and current Hina state | Verified |
| Current playback controls | Live popover Pause/Resume and toolbar labels; playback restored | Verified |
| Native chooser ownership | Opens sheet, Cancel returns to Library; no legacy saver detour | Verified |
| Wallpaper/display preservation | Existing Hina remains active; no display configuration operations | Verified for this work |

Final checkpoint commands passed:

- `./test.sh`
- `build/Idlesse.app/Contents/MacOS/Idlesse --smoke-home`
- `--smoke-library` with an existing 4K60 Ichika video; includes composed-video poster
- `git diff --check`

The development app was rebuilt and relaunched after app edits. The wallpaper
surface screenshot showed the current Hina scene rendered correctly. The UI
capture returns individual windows; it did not capture the combined menu material
and wallpaper in one image. That is not proof of visual menu-bar parity.

## Remaining qualification

- Measure user-visible desktop-reveal animation latency, distinct from the logged
  Mission Control dispatch completion.
- Inspect combined menu material and desktop for crop/color continuity. Paired
  timestamps cannot detect spatial mismatch or macOS blur/refraction.
- Determine whether the larger missed-copy count on display 1 warrants a scheduling
  change. Do not increase decode work or force the desktop to wait for the strip
  solely to make the counters look better.

The measured skew is an observed limitation of the current two-window presentation
path, not evidence that macOS cannot support a different implementation. No claim
of zero hitch, atomic presentation, global FPS improvement, or energy improvement
is made. The long-running qualification goal remains open.

## Drawable-buffer trial

The menu strip now permits three drawables (previously two); the ready/request
queue remains bounded to one each. Only the narrow strip gains a buffer.
With the existing wallpaper, before/after samples were:

| Buffer count | Display | Paired frames | Missed copies | Mean absolute skew | Maximum |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 2 | 3 | 9658 | 195 | 0.62 ms | 25.00 ms |
| 2 | 1 | 9066 | 2279 | 4.96 ms | 33.34 ms |
| 3 | 3 | 3725 | 57 | 0.80 ms | 25.00 ms |
| 3 | 1 | 3873 | 16 | 0.85 ms | 50.00 ms |

These are sequential, unequal-duration live samples, not controlled benchmarks.
The display-1 missed-copy ratio and mean improved markedly, but worst-case skew
increased; do not infer atomic synchronization or universally lower latency.
The main renderer does not wait for the strip and no additional decoder is used.

### Prepared scene handoff

Replacement selection now waits for render readiness before retiring the active scene or starting a crossfade. Candidates are ordered transparent, muted, and noninteractive during preparation. Metal readiness requires a completed full-frame GPU command; Standard video uses AVPlayerLayer readiness, and layered scenes require every visible child. A ten-second preparation deadline fails the selection rather than forcing an unready frame onto the desktop. Cancellation closes candidate windows and their shared decoder; candidate decoder errors are retained until selection can report failure, without stopping the existing wallpaper.

This preparation temporarily retains both scenes and their resources. The deadline bounds loading time, not peak memory. Further qualification should cover rapid replacement, decoder failure, and suspension during preparation.

The rebuilt app restored Hina, then completed Library selection Hina → Tiger → Hina. The final Library state reports Hina on desktop with playback running. This verifies ordinary real-media handoff completion; it is not a frame-by-frame latency measurement.

`--smoke-selection-transactions` now exercises the real selection controller with a deliberately delayed source that ignores cancellation. It verifies active surface identity is retained during loading, the newer request wins even when the old provider returns late, and a failed load retains the selected scene and surface while reporting exactly one error. It runs without presenting test wallpaper windows or persisting selection. This does not yet qualify decoder failure after render preparation begins.

Preparation also checks the surface generation, so display rebuilds invalidate pending candidates. Lifecycle cancellation restores the active package watcher and exits without an error dialog. Home shows a compact Loading indicator beside the current display status while preparation runs.

### Launch and replacement goal audit — September 13

| Requirement | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Keep backdrop visible during startup | Metal surface and menu strip stay transparent until successful GPU completion; rebuilt app restores Hina and reports it playing. |
| Keep active scene until replacement is ready | Adoption and crossfade begin only after all candidate surfaces report ready. Live Library Hina → Tiger → Hina completed. |
| Real first-frame readiness | `--smoke-video-preparation` with the existing Hina video passed shared-decoder preparation while candidate opacity remained zero and mouse interaction disabled. |
| Failed decoder stays invisible and cleans up | The same test gives the decoder a missing video; it reports failure without readiness or visibility, then closes candidate and hub. |
| Failed load preserves working scene | `--smoke-selection-transactions` checks selected URL and surface identity survive failure and only the current error is reported. |
| Rapid selection / late cancellation | The transaction test deliberately lets a cancelled source return after the latest selection; it cannot replace the active scene or report a stale error. |
| Loading feedback | Home keeps the active title and transport available, adding Loading… to destination status only while loading. Home smoke passes. |
| Preserve user state | Final native UI shows Hina On Desktop, Pause available, All Displays, and Wallpaper Sound unchecked. No display settings or source media were changed. |
| PR separation | #101 remains the product PR based on #113; the independent native provider experiment remains draft #114. |

Commands run on the final build: `--smoke-video-preparation <existing Hina.mp4>`, `--smoke-selection-transactions`, and `--smoke-home`. All passed. The earlier full suite also passed after main reconciliation.

Limits: readiness uses GPU command completion for Metal and AVPlayerLayer readiness for Standard; this is not a physical scanout synchronization guarantee. Keeping old and new decoders alive briefly increases transient memory. A preparation timeout preserves the previous selection rather than forcing an unready surface visible. Per-monitor hotplug and sleep behavior are guarded by generation/suspension checks but were not physically disturbed during this qualification. No universal load-time, energy, or frame-rate improvement is claimed.
